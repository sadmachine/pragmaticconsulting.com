        <h3 class="text-center">International Experience</h3>
        <p>Pragmatic consultants have worked in international markets that include: relocation and startup of manufacturing operations, mergers and acquisitions and complete turnkey projects helping companies with exporting “know how” such as: export
          market analysis and networking, documentation and controls, and many related systems and organizational projects. As a result, we have direct access to resources throughout the world. For example, Larry Bull, one of Pragmatic Consulting’s
          Principal Partners, has had direct responsibility for the establishment of a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in China in 1998, as well as others. This business broke even in its first year. Today, it is approaching $30 million in
          revenue and generating a significant profit. Products from this business are supplied to the domestic commercial vehicle industry in China and exported to the US and Europe. Several of Pragmatic's consultants have many years of international
          business experience.
        </p>
        <p>Pragmatic Consulting's vast experiences with many different customers enable us to quickly and efficiently achieve our clients’ objectives. Our consultants have successfully accomplished tactical projects to support strategic directions and
          initiatives in improving material flow, identifying capable and cost effective suppliers, implementing effective quality systems and organizational development. For a complete understanding of our various services or if we can answer your
