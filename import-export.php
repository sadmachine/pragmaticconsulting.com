          <strong>Global Experience</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Pragmatic consultants have many years of experience working in international markets such as: Europe, Asia and other areas of the Globe, including relocation and startup of manufacturing operations and have helped companies with exporting
          “know how”, such as export documentation and controls. As a result, we have direct access to resources throughout the world. For example, Larry Bull, one of Pragmatic Consulting’s Principal Partners, has had direct responsibility for the
          establishment of a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in Asia in 1998, as well as others. This WOFE business broke even in its first year. Today, it is approaching a tenfold increase in revenue and generating a significant profit. Products
          from this business are supplied to the domestic commercial vehicle industry and exported to the US and Europe.
        </p>
        <p>Pragmatic Consulting's vast experiences with many different customers enable us to quickly and efficiently achieve our clients’ objectives. Our consultants have successfully accomplished projects in improving material flow logistics, identifying
          capable and cost effective suppliers, improving supplier quality, and implementing effective quality systems and program/project management that has included plant startup and ramp up through the first year of production. Our networking
          ability in Europe and Asia and elsewhere provides the in-country support needed to successfully complete any assignment.</p>
