<p>Recently we managed a continuous improvement project for a Massachusetts company that consolidated two product aftermarket and OEM parts and service inventory warehouses into one.  Using Pragmatic's "Lean Warehouse" techniques we; coordinated the inventory transfer, installed ergonomic equipment, implemented systems integration, and improved quality and inventory accuracy.  Additionally, Pragmatic designed and laid out a "state of the art" warehouse resulting in improved flow of processes and material.</p>
