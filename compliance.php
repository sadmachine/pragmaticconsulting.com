        <p>Complying with the multitude of changing regulations enforced by these U. S. government agencies can be very
          complex, especially if your company does not have the resources necessary to ensure consistent ongoing trade
          compliance. Recent export
          control reforms are rapidly changing the compliance landscape, and failure to comply with the U.S. Export and
          Import Laws and Regulations may result in both civil and criminal penalties and substantial fines.
