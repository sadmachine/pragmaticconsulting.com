<p>JD Edwards is a long-standing Tier I fully integrated ERP system solution now owned by Oracle. Oracle’s Enterprise One as well as its OneWorld Manufacturing and Engineering helps manufacturers—especially those that operate within a mixed-mode
  (process, discrete, repetitive, etc.) manufacturing environment—develop, manufacture, and distribute products in a timely fashion; use efficient processes that optimize resources; and satisfy customer expectations about quality, price, and
  delivery. Now, with the addition of Oracle’s Agile Product Lifecycle Management solutions, engineers can work closely with the manufacturing and related capabilities of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.</p>
<p>Pragmatic’s Supply Chain & IT Systems consultants have extensive experience in the traditional OneWorld, as well as EnterpriseOne. We have successfully implemented JD Edwards and many others and have successfully implemented many ERP projects
  and other types of systems and sub-system solutions. Additionally, we have successfully integrated automation advances in many of our implementations throughout all the extended supply chain from forecasting and "quoting to cash" and beyond.
  This has also included successful manufacturing module implementations, warehouse management systems and integration among other improvements in not just Information Technology but operational efficiencies. If you are considering a full-service
  solution, Epicor should be on your list and is a viable solution in many cases. Indeed, we have put together cross functional teams that incorporate "Lean" techniques as well throughout the entire enterprise for maximum optimization. Whether
  you are a large or small organization, we provide you with customized expert advice and guidance through these processes to maximize success. This, coupled with our broad breadth of Information Technology expertise, is something hard to
  find in the over-specialized consulting world.</p>
