  Microsoft Dynamics has two major ERP software packages for small and medium size companies. AX: is a scalable,
  feature-rich enterprise resource planning solution for midmarket to enterprise companies and the larger of the two.
  Navision: is a small to
  midmarket solution. It has its roots in the former Great Plains software and is now a small ERP solution which
  supports the entire internal supply chain and everything from CRM to manufacturing and finance. Under certain
  circumstance Microsoft
  Dynamics can be an excellent fit to accelerate your business.
