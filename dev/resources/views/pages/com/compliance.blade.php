            Complying with the multitude of changing regulations enforced by these U.S. government agencies can be very
            complex, especially if your company does not have the resources necessary to ensure consistent ongoing trade
            compliance. Recent export control reforms are rapidly changing the compliance landscape, and failure to comply
            with the U.S. Export and Import Laws and Regulations may result in both civil and criminal penalties and
            substantial fines.
