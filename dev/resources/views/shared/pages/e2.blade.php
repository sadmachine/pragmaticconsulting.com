            Shoptech has had a shop software package that has been its flagship for a number of years and has
            traditionally been designed and utilized for small shops. Their E2 Mfg. package that has been developed in
            recent years is a great entry level but full ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software that offers control
            over advanced work orders, scheduling tools, quality control, data collection and more, all in one place. This
            allows you to eliminate waste and make your entire business more organized and efficient. E2 is also
            QuickBooks Gold Certified, meaning a seamless and easy integration between the two programs. E2 can be a great
            solution in numerous situations for companies of all sizes.
